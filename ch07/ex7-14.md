Does the following statement always compute the frational part of 
f correctly (assuming that f and frac_part are float variables)?

frac_part = f - (int) f;
If not, what's the problem?

My Answer: -- Wrong
Yes

Correct answer by KN
 No. Converting f to int will fail if the value stored in f exceeds the largest value of type int.
