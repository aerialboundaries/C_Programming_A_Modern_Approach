/* C Programming A Modern Approach ex 5-1.c

 * Q: The following program fragments illustrate the relational and equality
 * operatiors.  Show the output produced by each, assuming that i, j, and k are
 * int valiables.
 *
 * (a) i = 2; j = 3
 *      k = i * j ==6;
 *      printf(:%d, k);
 * (b) i = 5; j = 10; k = 1;
 *      printf("%d", k > i  < j);
 * (c) i = 3; j = 2; k = 1;
 *      printf("d", i < j == J < k);
 * (d) i = 3; j = 4; k = 5;
 *      printf("%d", i % j + i < k);
 *
 *  My answers:
 *  (a) 1
 *  (b)
