/* C Programming A Modern Approach ex 3-5.txt */

Suppose that we call scanf as follows:
scanf("%f%d%f", &x, &i, &y);
If the user enters
12.3 45.6 789
what will be the values of x, i, and y after the call? (Asuume that x and y are int variables and x is a float variable.)

My Answer: 
x = 12.3
i =  45
y = .6

This is OK!
